## Hi There!

I'm Monika Sembiring. I'm currently a product manager who manages end-to-end product development at [Warung Pintar](https://warungpintar.co.id/).

At work, I prioritize the backlog, do user research, define requirement documents, conduct sprint, and manage my team. But in my free time, I (try to) learn about data science using Python to become a well-rounded product manager.

This is my first time publishing a personal website. Therefore, here I will write about my thoughts, experiences, and learnings related to my professional life. I will try to keep it short (a couple of mins reading time I hope) as well as update it routinely.

You can find my perspective on things other than work/technical stuff on my [personal blog](https://sembiringmonika.wordpress.com/).

I hope you find something useful here. Enjoy your time looking around!

Btw, if you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions; or even want to discuss something writes down here, feel free to reach me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MonikaSembiring) anytime! I will very happy to have a discussion with you.
